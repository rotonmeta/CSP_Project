# CSP_Sudoku
Implementation, comparation and testing of CSP solver algorithms based on Backtracking. <br />

__Implementation__ of different inference strategies: 
1. Pure backtracking
2. Backtracking with forward checking (FC)
3. Maintaining arc consistency (MAC). <br />

__Comparation__ of the strategies in terms of _time complexity_ and _number of backtracks_. <br />
__Testing__ on _Sudoku_ game instances.

You can run the application from main.py and you also can change the test parameters from there. <br />
All the work and results are explained in the PDF paper included in this repository. <br />
Python 3.6 or later is required to run the application.
